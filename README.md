## Introduction

Welcome to the **RFCGPT** repository, a burgeoning community focused on the vertical domain of network protocols. Officially backed by [Rfcgpt.com](http://www.rfcgpt.com), this project aims to become an indispensable resource for professionals whose work is heavily reliant on RFC (Request For Comments) documents.

**Current Status**: We're in the community preparation stage. If you're interested in joining us, feel free to reach out!

## Getting Started

Before you can start using RFCGPT, you'll need to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rfcgpt/rfcgpt.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd rfcgpt`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Run the application: `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Features

- **Protocol Insights**: Gain deep insights into a wide range of network protocols.
- **Fast Search**: Quick search functionality that understands the context of RFCs.
- **Documentation Support**: Generate parts of your documentation based on RFC data.
- **Network Packet Construction with PTE (Protocol Test Engine): Utilize PTE to create and send network packets for various protocols, easing your testing processes.

## Contributing

We're in the early stages of community formation and are more than open to contributions! If you're interested in contributing to RFCGPT, please take a look at our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Roadmap

As the community is still in the preparatory phase, our roadmap is a work in progress. The following milestones are being targeted:

- **Q4 2023**: Launch the first functional version of the model based on ChatGPT and PTE (Protocol Test Engine) for initiating arbitrary protocol messages.
- **Q1 2024**: Train the first version of the domain-specific large model, as ChatGPT has not covered all RFC content.
- **Q2 2024**: Open up the community for plugin contributions.
